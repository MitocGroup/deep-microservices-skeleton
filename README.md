## Getting Started

Install DEEP CLI, also known as deepify:

```bash
npm install deepify -g
```

> If you want to use `deepify` on Windows, please follow the steps from
[Windows Configuration](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework/blob/master/docs/windows.md)
before running `npm install deepify -g` and make sure all `npm` and `deepify` commands are executed
inside Git Bash.

Using deepify, dump locally the deep-microservices-skeleton repository:

```bash
deepify install github://MitocGroup/deep-microservices-skeleton ~/deep-microservices-skeleton
```

> If you first run `mkdir ~/deep-microservices-skeleton && cd ~/deep-microservices-skeleton`,
then optional path parameter `~/deep-microservices-skeleton` can be skipped in all `deepify` commands

Next, run locally the web application in deep-microservices-skeleton:

```bash
deepify server ~/deep-microservices-skeleton -o
```

> When this step is finished, you can open in your browser the link *http://localhost:8000*
and enjoy the deep-microservices-skeleton running locally.

Finally, deploy the deep-microservices-skeleton to cloud provider:

```bash
deepify deploy ~/deep-microservices-skeleton
```

> Amazon CloudFront distribution takes up to 20 minutes to provision, therefore donâ€™t worry
if it returns an HTTP error in the first couple of minutes.
